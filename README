Depends on libdrm, libevent2, libfreetype2 and libxkbcommon.
Includes libteken (from the FreeBSD base system) for the actual terminal
emulation.
By default it additionally expects to find the x11-fonts/dejavu font files
(but font file can be overridden with the -f option if necessary).

Only tested on DragonFly BSD so far, but it's likely that everything
builds and works with minor adjustments on FreeBSD.
Small adjustments will be needed for Linux support, and some details of vt
switching support are missing for Linux.

GNUMakefile is currently broken, and the current state is completely untested
on Linux.


TODO

Needs more error handling.

Improve performance of the terminal emulation. Especially the fbteken_copy
operation still needs some optimizing, e.g. by optimizing the layout of the
terminal-cell buffer, or by optimizing away unneeded terminal operations..

Keycode translation is currently tailored towards ISO and ANSI keyboard
layouts. Special keys from e.g. japanese keyboards aren't handled yet.

No support for keyboard LEDs yet.
