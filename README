Depends on libdrm, libevent2, libfreetype2 and libxkbcommon.
Includes libteken (from the FreeBSD base system) for the actual terminal
emulation.

Only tested on DragonFly BSD so far, but it's likely that everything
builds and works with minor adjustments on FreeBSD.
Small adjustments will be needed for Linux support, and some details of vt
switching support are missing for Linux.


TODO

Needs more error handling.

Improve performance of the terminal emulation. Especially the fbteken_copy
operation needs optimizing, e.g. by optimizing the layout of the terminal-cell
buffer, or by optimizing away unneeded terminal operations..
