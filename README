Depends on libdrm, libteken (from the FreeBSD base system) and libfreetype.

On DragonFly BSD, libteken currently needs to be copied from the FreeBSD
source tree and manually built.

Only tested on DragonFly BSD so far, but it's likely that everything
builds and works with minor adjustments on FreeBSD.


TODO

Use libevent2 instead of separate threads.

Do vsync by reading from the drm device, instead of redrawing based on a timer.

Improve performance of the terminal emulation. Especially the fbteken_copy
operation needs optimizing, e.g. by optimizing the layout of the terminal-cell
buffer, or by optimizing away unneeded terminal operations..
